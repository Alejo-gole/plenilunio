# 🌕 Plenilunio

**Plenilunio** is a minimalist web application designed to create a symbolic, daily connection with the moon's natural cycle.  
It offers users a simple interface to view the current moon phase, its illumination percentage, and a daily reflection message based on their selected location.

🌱 Philosophy

Plenilunio is more than code—it's a contemplative gesture.
It lives in the rhythm of the moon, not in scrolls or feeds.
Designed with minimal environmental impact and maximal poetic intent.
